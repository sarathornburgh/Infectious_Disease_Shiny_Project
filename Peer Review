13. 1) Be sure to upload a readme and vignette! I know it would be different because the app is not in hoffman, but maybe just include some basics about your app. 2) The app is easy to use and works perfectly! But, if possible, it might be interesting to have the sliders for Total Population and Number of people infected at beginning move in larger intervals, because changing it by 1 doesnt affect the graph very much
